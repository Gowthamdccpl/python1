## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Animal welfare organizations worldwide face significant challenges in managing pet adoption processes, healthcare services, and administrative operations. Traditional paper-based systems and fragmented digital solutions often result in inefficient workflows, delayed communications, and suboptimal matching between pets and potential adopters [1]. In India, with an estimated 62 million stray dogs and growing urban pet populations, the need for efficient animal care management systems has become increasingly critical [2].

The complexity of modern pet care involves multiple stakeholders including adopters, veterinarians, administrative staff, and volunteers, each requiring different interfaces and functionalities. Current solutions typically address individual aspects of pet care management but lack comprehensive integration, leading to data silos and operational inefficiencies [3].

### 1.2 Problem Statement

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Animal Adoption and Welfare Systems

Research in animal adoption has identified several factors influencing successful placements. Brown and Morgan [4] analyzed adoption patterns and found that age, breed, and physical characteristics significantly impact adoption rates. Protopopova and Wynne [5] demonstrated that behavioral assessments and adopter-animal interactions are crucial predictors of adoption success.

Weiss et al. [1] conducted comprehensive studies on lost and found animal processes, highlighting the importance of efficient tracking and communication systems. Their findings emphasize the need for integrated platforms that can handle multiple aspects of animal welfare operations.

### 2.2 Technology in Animal Management

Digital transformation in animal welfare has gained momentum with various technological solutions. Hawes et al. [6] studied factors influencing animal returns to shelters, identifying communication gaps and inadequate matching as primary causes. This research supports the need for better technological solutions in adoption processes.

Gunter et al. [7] investigated the impact of breed labeling and perceptions on adoption outcomes, demonstrating how data-driven approaches can improve adoption strategies. Their work highlights the potential for AI systems to reduce bias and improve matching accuracy.

### 2.3 AI and Machine Learning in Animal Care

Recent advances in AI have shown promising applications in animal care. Norouzzadeh et al. [8] developed deep learning systems for automatic animal identification and counting, demonstrating the feasibility of AI in animal-related applications. Willi et al. [9] extended this work to citizen science applications, showing how AI can scale animal monitoring efforts.

Chen et al. [10] implemented convolutional neural networks for species recognition in wildlife monitoring, providing foundational techniques applicable to domestic animal management systems.

### 2.4 Healthcare Management Systems

Digital healthcare management has evolved significantly with mobile and web technologies. Kumar et al. [11] evaluated mobile health technologies, establishing frameworks for effectiveness assessment that are applicable to veterinary care systems. Steinhubl et al. [12] discussed emerging trends in mobile health, providing insights relevant to pet healthcare applications.

### 2.5 User Experience in Non-Profit Technology

Nah and Saxton [13] studied technology adoption in non-profit organizations, identifying key factors for successful implementation. Their research emphasizes the importance of user-centered design and stakeholder engagement in non-profit technology solutions.

Saxton and Wang [14] analyzed social media and digital giving patterns, providing insights relevant to donation and engagement features in animal welfare platforms.
