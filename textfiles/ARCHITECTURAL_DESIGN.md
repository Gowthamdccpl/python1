# Pet Care Management System - Architectural Design

## Overview
The Pet Care Management System is a comprehensive web-based application built using Flask framework, designed to provide pet care services including adoption, veterinary appointments, food recommendations, and nearby services location.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Frontend Layer (Presentation Tier)
- **Technology**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Components**:
  - Web Browser Interface
  - Responsive UI Templates (Jinja2)
  - Static Assets (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
  - Interactive Forms and Modals

### 2. Application Layer (Business Logic Tier)
- **Technology**: Flask (Python Web Framework)
- **Core Modules**:

#### Core Routes & Features:
- **Home Dashboard**: Statistics and overview
- **Adoption System**: Pet listing and adoption applications
- **Appointment Booking**: Veterinary appointment scheduling
- **Food Recommendation**: AI-powered pet food suggestions
- **Donation System**: Payment processing with QR codes
- **Nearby Services**: GPS-based service location
- **Contact System**: Communication interface

#### Admin Panel:
- **Authentication**: Session-based admin login
- **Pet Management**: CRUD operations for pet records
- **Appointment Management**: View and manage appointments
- **Adoption Management**: Process adoption applications
- **Dashboard**: Administrative overview and notifications

#### AI/ML Engine:
- **Random Forest Model**: Trained classification model
- **Food Prediction Engine**: Recommendation algorithm
- **Dataset Processing**: JSON-based food data management

### 3. Data Layer (Data Tier)
- **Primary Database**: SQLite (petcare.db)
- **Database Tables**:
  - `pets`: Pet information and adoption status
  - `appointments`: Veterinary appointment records
  - `adoption_applications`: Adoption form submissions
  - `donations`: Payment and donation records

- **File Storage**:
  - Pet images (`static/images/pets/`)
  - ML model files (`model.pkl`, `food_mapping.pkl`)
  - JSON datasets (`food_data.json`, `pets_data.json`)

### 4. External Services Integration
- **Google Maps API**: Location services and mapping
- **Payment Gateway**: G Pay/Phone Pay integration
- **GPS Services**: Real-time location detection

### 5. Testing & Monitoring Layer
- **Health Check System**: Automated endpoint testing
- **Manual Test Checklist**: Comprehensive testing procedures
- **Unit Testing Framework**: Component-level testing

## Technology Stack

### Backend Technologies:
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database operations
- **Flask-Migrate**: Database migration management
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI utilities and security
- **Gunicorn**: WSGI HTTP Server (production)

### Machine Learning:
- **scikit-learn**: ML model training and prediction
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computing
- **joblib**: Model serialization

### Frontend Technologies:
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Structure and styling
- **JavaScript**: Client-side interactivity
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive design framework
- **Jinja2**: Template engine

## Database Schema

### Pets Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- name, type, breed, age, gender
- size, color, description
- health_status, vaccination_status
- spayed_neutered, special_needs
- adoption_fee, contact_info
- location, image, status
- date_added
```

### Appointments Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- owner_name, email, phone
- pet_name, pet_type, pet_age, age_unit
- appointment_type, appointment_date, appointment_time
- notes, status, created_at, updated_at
```

### Adoption Applications Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- pet_id (Foreign Key)
- applicant_name, email, phone, address
- experience_with_pets, living_situation
- application_status, application_date, notes
```

### Donations Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- donor_name, email, amount
- payment_method, transaction_id
- donation_date, purpose, status, notes
```

## Security Features
- Session-based authentication for admin panel
- CSRF protection on forms
- Secure file upload handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through ORM

## Deployment Architecture
- **Development**: Flask development server
- **Production**: Gunicorn WSGI server
- **Platform**: Heroku-ready with Procfile
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production option)
